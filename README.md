# Expense-Tracker-App
A simple and responsive Expense Tracker built with HTML5,CSS3, and JavaScript(ES6). This app lets you keep track of your income and expenses in real-time, categorize your transactions, and store everything locally in your browser.

## Features

- Add income and expense transactions
- Automatic date logging for each entry
- Categorize transactions (e.g., Food, Transport, Salary)
- Real-time balance, income, and expense calculations
- Delete individual transactions with confirmation
- Persistent storage using `localStorage`

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ayushikumari16/expense-tracker.git
   expense-tracker/
── index.html        # Main HTML file
── style.css         # Styling with CSS3
── script.js         # Logic in ES6 JavaScript
── README.md         # Project documentation

## Built With
HTML5
CSS3 (Flexbox)
Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)
Local Storage API

## Concepts Covered
This project was a great opportunity to practice:
DOM manipulation
Form validation and event handling
Array methods: .map(), .filter(), .reduce()
Local storage data persistence
Creating modular, readable code

## Why I Built This
I wanted a lightweight tool to track my personal finances and practice core front-end skills without relying on libraries or frameworks. It’s also a useful sandbox to expand on later — maybe adding chart.js, login functionality, or backend integration.
